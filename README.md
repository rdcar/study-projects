# Data Science Study Projects Summary

Welcome to the **Study Projects** repository! This is a centralized hub for all my data science study projects. Here, you'll find a collection of individual repositories, each dedicated to a specific project or area of study within the field of data science.

The purpose of this repository is to organize and showcase my journey and progress in learning data science. Each sub-repository focuses on different aspects of data science, from data cleaning and visualization to machine learning and deep learning.

## Project Description

This repository is dedicated to a study project focused on predicting cancer based on RNA sequencing data. The data were collected from [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga), an international program that characterizes over 33 types of cancer. Each row represents a sample from an individual, with columns representing different microRNAs and their expression levels. Expression values range from $[0, \infty]$, where values close to zero indicate low expression and higher values indicate high expression. Labels include TP (primary solid tumor) indicating cancer and NT (normal tissue).

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a model to predict cancer presence based on RNA sequencing data.

## Data Sources

1. [The Cancer Genome Atlas Program](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)
2. [Micro RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA_sequencing)
3. [Sklearn Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)

## Future Work

As my studies progress, I will continue to improve the model's hyperparameters and experiment with different algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.
